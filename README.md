# 3wille/Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles.

This repository uses thoughtbot's [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) with a tag-directory per
OS. Syncs between the different OS-specific versions of the dotfiles are done manually.

## Installation
1. See rcm.
2. Install [parcel](https://github.com/jamescmartinez/parcel) to install atom packages.

```
apm install parcel
```
